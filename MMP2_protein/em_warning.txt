WARNING 1 [file minim.mdp]:
  The largest distance between excluded atoms is 1.694 nm, which is larger
  than the cut-off distance. This will lead to missing long-range
  corrections in the forces and energies. If you expect that minimization
  will bring such distances within the cut-off, you can ignore this warning.
