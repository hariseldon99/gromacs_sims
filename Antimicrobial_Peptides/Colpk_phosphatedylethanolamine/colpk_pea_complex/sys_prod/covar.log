Program: covar
Working directory: /home/daneel/gitrepos/gromacs_sims/Colpk_phosphatedylethanolamine/colpk_pea_complex/sys_prod

Read 5001 frames from prod_colpk_pea_complex_compact_compact.xtc (time 0 to 50000 ps)
Read reference structure for fit from start.pdb
Read index groups from prod_colpk_pea_complex_pca.ndx

Analysis group is 'Backbone_PEA' (1201 atoms)
Fit group is 'Backbone_PEA' (1201 atoms)
Analysis is non-mass weighted
Fit is non-mass weighted
Diagonalized the 3603x3603 covariance matrix
Trace of the covariance matrix before diagonalizing: 3566.24
Trace of the covariance matrix after diagonalizing: 3566.24

Wrote 3603 eigenvalues to prod_colpk_pea_complex_eigenvalues.xvg
Wrote reference structure to prod_colpk_pea_complex_eigenvectors.trr
Wrote average structure to average.pdb and prod_colpk_pea_complex_eigenvectors.trr
Wrote eigenvectors 1 to 3603 to prod_colpk_pea_complex_eigenvectors.trr
