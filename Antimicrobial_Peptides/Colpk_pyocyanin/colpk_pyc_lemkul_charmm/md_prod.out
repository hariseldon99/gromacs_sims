Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.297 nm, buffer size 0.097 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.225 nm, buffer size 0.025 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup

The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
gmx mdrun was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding gmx mdrun with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.
