Read 5001 frames from prod_ku04amp01_pea_complex_compact_compact.xtc (time 0 to 50000 ps)
Read reference structure for fit from start.pdb
Read index groups from prod_ku04amp01_pea_complex_pca.ndx

Analysis group is 'Backbone_EA1' (145 atoms)
Fit group is 'Backbone_EA1' (145 atoms)
Analysis is non-mass weighted
Fit is non-mass weighted
