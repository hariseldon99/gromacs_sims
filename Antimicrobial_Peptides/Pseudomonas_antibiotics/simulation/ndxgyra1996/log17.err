Ignoring obsolete mdp entry 'ns-type'
Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 921120.00
The integrator does not provide a ensemble temperature, there is no system ensemble temperature

NOTE 1 [file /home/arunima/gitrepos/gromacs_sims/Antimicrobial_Peptides/Pseudomonas_antibiotics/simulation/ndxgyra1996/1a546e10-f6cf-43b5-a772-c729101b8fcd/grompp.mdp]:
  Removing center of mass motion in the presence of position restraints
  might cause artifacts. When you are using position restraints to
  equilibrate a macro-molecule, the artifacts are usually negligible.


There was 1 NOTE

GROMACS reminds you: "It is an unfortunate fact that when you raise the question of the reliability of many simulations you are often told about how much manpower went into it, how large & fast the computer is, how important the problem is, and such things, which are completely irrelevant to the question that was asked." (Richard Hamming)
