The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
gmx mdrun was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding gmx mdrun with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.

On host kuhpcgn2 1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 4 GPU tasks in the 4 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 4 MPI threads
Using 16 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread


Steepest Descents:
   Tolerance (Fmax)   =  5.00000e+02
   Number of steps    =        15000

writing lowest energy coordinates.

Steepest Descents converged to Fmax < 500 in 4582 steps
Potential Energy  = -8.1421935e+06
Maximum force     =  4.8503772e+02 on atom 14272
Norm of force     =  6.8404232e+00
