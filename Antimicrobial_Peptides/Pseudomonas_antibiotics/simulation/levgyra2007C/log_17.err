Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 921231.00
The integrator does not provide a ensemble temperature, there is no system ensemble temperature

NOTE 1 [file /home/admin/gitrepos/gromacs_sims/Antimicrobial_Peptides/Pseudomonas_antibiotics/simulation/levgyra2007C/sandbox_fc55739c-721e-40ea-975b-ebc30f6a6ccb/grompp.mdp]:
  Removing center of mass motion in the presence of position restraints
  might cause artifacts. When you are using position restraints to
  equilibrate a macro-molecule, the artifacts are usually negligible.


There was 1 NOTE

GROMACS reminds you: "When I got my first job as a programmer there were quite a number of women doing programming because there was no computer science education and people were hired from many different fields if it seemed like they could do the work. It was better then, probably, in terms of proportions, not necessarily in women being paid as much as men and so forth, but definitely, there were women around." (Barbara Liskov)
