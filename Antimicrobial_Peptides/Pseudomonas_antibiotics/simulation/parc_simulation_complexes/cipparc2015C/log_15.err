NOTE 1 [file ligand.top, line 73]:
  System has non-zero total charge: -14.000000
  Total charge should normally be an integer. See
  https://manual.gromacs.org/current/user-guide/floating-point.html
  for discussion on how close it should be to an integer.




WARNING 1 [file ligand.top, line 73]:
  You are using Ewald electrostatics in a system with net charge. This can
  lead to severe artifacts, such as ions moving into regions with low
  dielectric, due to the uniform background charge. We suggest to
  neutralize your system with counter ions, possibly in combination with a
  physiological salt concentration.

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 3112989.00
The integrator does not provide a ensemble temperature, there is no system ensemble temperature

NOTE 2 [file /host_pwd/cipparc2015C/sandbox_2f3a0e28-e6a5-4728-9ab9-658f65062b39/grompp.mdp]:
  Removing center of mass motion in the presence of position restraints
  might cause artifacts. When you are using position restraints to
  equilibrate a macro-molecule, the artifacts are usually negligible.
