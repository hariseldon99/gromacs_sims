The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
gmx mdrun was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding gmx mdrun with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.

On host kuhpcgn1 1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 4 GPU tasks in the 4 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 4 MPI threads
Using 16 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread


Steepest Descents:
   Tolerance (Fmax)   =  5.00000e+02
   Number of steps    =        15000

Energy minimization has stopped, but the forces have not converged to the
requested precision Fmax < 500 (which may not be possible for your system).
It stopped because the algorithm tried to make a new step whose size was too
small, or there was no change in the energy since last step. Either way, we
regard the minimization as converged to within the available machine
precision, given your starting configuration and EM parameters.

Double precision normally gives you higher accuracy, but this is often not
needed for preparing to run molecular dynamics.
You might need to increase your constraint accuracy, or turn
off constraints altogether (set constraints = none in mdp file)

writing lowest energy coordinates.

Steepest Descents converged to machine precision in 4068 steps,
but did not reach the requested Fmax < 500.
Potential Energy  = -2.7938002e+07
Maximum force     =  8.3206650e+03 on atom 6391
Norm of force     =  1.3417307e+01

GROMACS reminds you: "When using an abacus, a human can achieve about 0.1 flops/watt. Super-computers achieve about 2 gigaflops/watt." (John Linford)
