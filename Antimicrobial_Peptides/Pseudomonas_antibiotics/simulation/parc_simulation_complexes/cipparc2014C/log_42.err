Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 3107331.00
The integrator does not provide a ensemble temperature, there is no system ensemble temperature

NOTE 1 [file /host_pwd/cipparc2014C/sandbox_b150a02d-e115-4faa-b0c0-04efb41aae37/grompp.mdp]:
  Removing center of mass motion in the presence of position restraints
  might cause artifacts. When you are using position restraints to
  equilibrate a macro-molecule, the artifacts are usually negligible.
