Ignoring obsolete mdp entry 'ns-type'
Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5

NOTE 1 [file ligand.top, line 72]:
  You are combining position restraints with Parrinello-Rahman pressure
  coupling, which can lead to instabilities. If you really want to combine
  position restraints with pressure coupling, we suggest to use C-rescale
  pressure coupling instead.

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group Protein_Other is 55970.95
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group Water_and_ions is 3040101.00

NOTE 2 [file /host_pwd/ndxparc2014C/sandbox_ccb74b85-4be9-4898-98bf-54b22c5240ea/grompp.mdp]:
  Removing center of mass motion in the presence of position restraints
  might cause artifacts. When you are using position restraints to
  equilibrate a macro-molecule, the artifacts are usually negligible.

Last frame         -1 time  100.000   

NOTE 3 [file /host_pwd/ndxparc2014C/sandbox_ccb74b85-4be9-4898-98bf-54b22c5240ea/grompp.mdp]:
  This run will generate roughly 4059 Mb of data
