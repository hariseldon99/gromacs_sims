Ignoring obsolete mdp entry 'ns-type'
Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 3112902.00
The integrator does not provide a ensemble temperature, there is no system ensemble temperature

NOTE 1 [file /host_pwd/ndxparc2007C/sandbox_2dbdda78-68bd-4bb4-b837-7de834fd2c71/grompp.mdp]:
  Removing center of mass motion in the presence of position restraints
  might cause artifacts. When you are using position restraints to
  equilibrate a macro-molecule, the artifacts are usually negligible.
