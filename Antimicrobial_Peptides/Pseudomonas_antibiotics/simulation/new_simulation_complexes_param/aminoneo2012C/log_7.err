Reading structure file

GROMACS reminds you: "It is an unfortunate fact that when you raise the question of the reliability of many simulations you are often told about how much manpower went into it, how large & fast the computer is, how important the problem is, and such things, which are completely irrelevant to the question that was asked." (Richard Hamming)
