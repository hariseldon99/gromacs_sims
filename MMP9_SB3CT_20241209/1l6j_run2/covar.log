Read 50001 frames from md500_compact_compact.xtc (time 0 to 500000 ps)
Read reference structure for fit from md500_start.pdb
Read index groups from md500_pca.ndx

Analysis group is 'Backbone_ZN2_LIG' (1265 atoms)
Fit group is 'Backbone_ZN2_LIG' (1265 atoms)
Analysis is non-mass weighted
Fit is non-mass weighted
Diagonalized the 3795x3795 covariance matrix
Trace of the covariance matrix before diagonalizing: 57.0323
Trace of the covariance matrix after diagonalizing: 57.0323

Wrote 3795 eigenvalues to eigenvalues.xvg
Wrote reference structure to eigenvectors.trr
