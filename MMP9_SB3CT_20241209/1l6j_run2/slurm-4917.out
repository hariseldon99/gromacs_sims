Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 1

NOTE 1 [file topol.top, line 54]:
  In moleculetype 'Other_chain_A2' 2 atoms are not bound by a potential or
  constraint to any other atom in the same moleculetype. Although
  technically this might not cause issues in a simulation, this often means
  that the user forgot to add a bond/potential/constraint or put multiple
  molecules in the same moleculetype definition by mistake. Run with -v to
  get information for each atom.

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group Protein_LIG_ZN2 is 15543.61
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group Water_and_ions is 104595.39

The largest distance between excluded atoms is 0.454 nm between atom 2935 and 3317

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 300 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.293 nm, buffer size 0.093 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.220 nm, buffer size 0.020 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup

Update groups can not be used for this system because atoms that are (in)directly constrained together are interdispersed with other atoms

1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 2 GPU tasks in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0,PME:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged and most bonded interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the GPU
PME tasks will do all aspects on the GPU
