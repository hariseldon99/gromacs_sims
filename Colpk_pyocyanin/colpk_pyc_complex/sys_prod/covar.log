Program: covar
Working directory: /home/daneel/gitrepos/gromacs_sims/Colpk_pyocyanin/colpk_pyc_complex/sys_prod

Read 5001 frames from prod_colpk_pyc_complex_compact_compact.xtc (time 0 to 50000 ps)
Read reference structure for fit from start.pdb
Read index groups from prod_colpk_pyc_complex_pca.ndx

Analysis group is 'Backbone_PYC' (1190 atoms)
Fit group is 'Backbone_PYC' (1190 atoms)
Analysis is non-mass weighted
Fit is non-mass weighted
Diagonalized the 3570x3570 covariance matrix
Trace of the covariance matrix before diagonalizing: 216.73
Trace of the covariance matrix after diagonalizing: 216.73

Wrote 3570 eigenvalues to prod_colpk_pyc_complex_eigenvalues.xvg
Wrote reference structure to prod_colpk_pyc_complex_eigenvectors.trr
Wrote average structure to average.pdb and prod_colpk_pyc_complex_eigenvectors.trr
Wrote eigenvectors 1 to 3570 to prod_colpk_pyc_complex_eigenvectors.trr
