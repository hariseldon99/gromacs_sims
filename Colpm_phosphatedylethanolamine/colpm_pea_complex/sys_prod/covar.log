Program: covar
Working directory: /home/daneel/gitrepos/gromacs_sims/Colpm_phosphatedylethanolamine/colpm_pea_complex/sys_prod

Read 10001 frames from prod_colpm_pea_complex_compact_compact.xtc (time 0 to 100000 ps)
Read reference structure for fit from start.pdb
Read index groups from prod_colpm_pea_complex_pca.ndx

Analysis group is 'Backbone_PEA' (1180 atoms)
Fit group is 'Backbone_PEA' (1180 atoms)
Analysis is non-mass weighted
Fit is non-mass weighted
Diagonalized the 3540x3540 covariance matrix
Trace of the covariance matrix before diagonalizing: 68.2895
Trace of the covariance matrix after diagonalizing: 68.2894

Wrote 3540 eigenvalues to prod_colpm_pea_complex_eigenvalues.xvg
Wrote reference structure to prod_colpm_pea_complex_eigenvectors.trr
Wrote average structure to average.pdb and prod_colpm_pea_complex_eigenvectors.trr
Wrote eigenvectors 1 to 3540 to prod_colpm_pea_complex_eigenvectors.trr
