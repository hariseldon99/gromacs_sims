Program: covar
Working directory: /home/daneel/gitrepos/gromacs_sims/zeb_hb/zeb_hb_phz_complex_sim/sys_prod

Read 20001 frames from prod_zeb_hb_phz_complex_compact_compact.xtc (time 0 to 200000 ps)
Read reference structure for fit from start.pdb
Read index groups from pca_index.ndx

Analysis group is 'Backbone_PHZ' (445 atoms)
Fit group is 'Backbone_PHZ' (445 atoms)
Analysis is non-mass weighted
Fit is non-mass weighted
Diagonalized the 1335x1335 covariance matrix
Trace of the covariance matrix before diagonalizing: 7.42135
Trace of the covariance matrix after diagonalizing: 7.42136

Wrote 1335 eigenvalues to prod_zeb_hb_phz_complex_eigenvalues.xvg
Wrote reference structure to prod_zeb_hb_phz_complex_eigenvectors.trr
Wrote average structure to average.pdb and prod_zeb_hb_phz_complex_eigenvectors.trr
Wrote eigenvectors 1 to 1335 to prod_zeb_hb_phz_complex_eigenvectors.trr
