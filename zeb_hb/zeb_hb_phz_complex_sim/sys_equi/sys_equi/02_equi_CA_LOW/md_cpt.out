Executable:   /usr/local/bin.AVX2_256/gmx
Data prefix:  /usr/local
Working dir:  /host_pwd
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -s equi_CA_LOW_zeb_hb_phz_complex.tpr -deffnm equi_CA_LOW_zeb_hb_phz_complex -nt 16 -ntmpi 0 -nsteps -2 -nocopyright -gpu_id 0 -append -cpi equi_CA_LOW_zeb_hb_phz_complex.cpt

The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
gmx mdrun was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding gmx mdrun with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.
Reading file equi_CA_LOW_zeb_hb_phz_complex.tpr, VERSION 2024.2-conda_forge (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 1 to 1.175

Update groups can not be used for this system because atoms that are (in)directly constrained together are interdispersed with other atoms

1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 2 GPU tasks in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0,PME:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the GPU
PME tasks will do all aspects on the GPU
Using 1 MPI thread
Using 16 OpenMP threads 


NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cpus
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin threads to cpus.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).

2000000 steps,   4000.0 ps (continuing from step 2000000,   4000.0 ps).

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: 31 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)

GROMACS reminds you: "Mendeleev's first attempt, the perfluoric table, was a total disaster, and his subsequent attempts, the perchloric and perbromic tables, were not favorably received. Only his fourth attempt, the periodic table, gained general acceptance." (Anonymous)
