If phenylhydrazine is near a leucine (LEU) residue that is adjacent to an alanine (ALA) residue, the interaction would primarily involve hydrophobic interactions rather than hydrogen bonding. Both leucine and alanine are hydrophobic amino acids, meaning they tend to avoid water and prefer to interact with other nonpolar molecules or residues.

### Hydrophobic Interactions
- **Leucine (LEU)**: Has a larger, more complex hydrophobic side chain.
- **Alanine (ALA)**: Has a smaller, simpler hydrophobic side chain.

### Interaction with Phenylhydrazine
Phenylhydrazine itself has a hydrophobic phenyl ring, which can interact favorably with the hydrophobic side chains of leucine and alanine. These interactions help stabilize the binding of phenylhydrazine to the protein through van der Waals forces and hydrophobic effects.

### Hydrogen Bonding
Since neither leucine nor alanine has polar side chains, they cannot directly participate in hydrogen bonding with phenylhydrazine. However, if there are nearby residues with polar or charged side chains, those could potentially form hydrogen bonds with phenylhydrazine.

### Example Scenario
If phenylhydrazine is positioned near a leucine and alanine residue, it might be stabilized by the hydrophobic environment created by these residues. This could bring phenylhydrazine into proximity with other residues capable of hydrogen bonding, such as serine or threonine, if they are present nearby.

## PHZ and GLY
Yes, hydrogen bonds can form between a phenylhydrazine ligand and the glycine (GLY) residue in a protein. Glycine, being a small and flexible amino acid, often participates in hydrogen bonding through its backbone amide group (NH) and carbonyl group (C=O) ³. 

Phenylhydrazine has functional groups that can act as hydrogen bond donors or acceptors, such as the NH and NH2 groups. These groups can form hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen or the amide hydrogen of the glycine residue in the protein ¹².


Here is a table summarizing the possible hydrogen bonds between phenylhydrazine and a glycine residue, including the donor and acceptor groups:


| **Phenylhydrazine Group** | **Glycine Group**       | **Donor** | **Acceptor** |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|-----------|--------------|
| NH (amine)                | C=O (carbonyl)          | NH        | C=O          |
| NH2 (amine)               | C=O (carbonyl)          | NH2       | C=O          |
| NH (amine)                | NH (amide)              | NH        | NH           |
| NH2 (amine)               | NH (amide)              | NH2       | NH           |

# However

This reference [Magnusson et. al. J Biol Chem. 2004](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m311890200) says that Leucine CAN form h-bonds (leucine and phenylalanine), but here leucine is in the ligand (I think).

Copilot suggests the following bond table

| **Donor Group**          | **Acceptor Group**       | **Hydrogen Bond**       |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Phenylhydrazine - NH2    | Leucine - CO (carbonyl)  | NH2 (phenylhydrazine) - CO (leucine) |
| Phenylhydrazine - NH     | Leucine - CO (carbonyl)  | NH (phenylhydrazine) - CO (leucine)  |
| Leucine - NH (amide)     | Phenylhydrazine - NH2    | NH (leucine) - NH2 (phenylhydrazine) |
| Leucine - NH (amide)     | Phenylhydrazine - NH     | NH (leucine) - NH (phenylhydrazine)  |
