## Integrated Multi-Stage Screening of Bioactive Compounds from Medicinal Plants for treating Women's Lifestyle Disorders
The project  aims to identify and validate bioactive compounds from medicinal plants to treat conditions like PCOS, diabetes, and obesity. The study involves several stages: 

1. in silico screening to predict interactions between plant compounds and key proteins, 
2. in vitro studies to assess cytotoxicity, and 
3. in vivo studies using animal models to validate therapeutic potential. 

### Key proteins targeted 

#### For PCOS:
* Insulin receptor: Targeting insulin resistance.
* Androgen receptor: Involved in elevated androgen levels.
* CYP17A1: An enzyme involved in androgen biosynthesis.
* AMH (Anti-Müllerian Hormone): Elevated in PCOS, influencing ovarian function.
  
### For Diabetes:
* Insulin receptor (IR): Central to glucose uptake and regulation of insulin sensitivity.
* GLUT4: The glucose transporter responsible for insulin-mediated glucose uptake.
* AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase): A key regulator of energy balance, involved in glucose and lipid metabolism.
* PPAR-γ (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma): A regulator of adipogenesis and glucose metabolism.
* GSK-3β (Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta): A kinase involved in insulin signaling.
* P-ERK (Phosphorylated ERK): MAPK involved in insulin signaling.

### For Obesity:
* Leptin receptor: Involved in regulating appetite and energy balance.
* PPAR-γ: A major regulator of fat cell differentiation and metabolism.
* CPT-1 (Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1): Involved in fatty acid oxidation.
* Adiponectin: A protein that modulates glucose regulation and fatty acid breakdown.
