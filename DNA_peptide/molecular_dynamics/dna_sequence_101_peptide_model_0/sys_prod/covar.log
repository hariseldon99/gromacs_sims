Working directory: /home/daneel/gitrepos/gromacs_sims/DNA_peptide/molecular_dynamics/dna_sequence_101_peptide_model_0/sys_prod

Read 5001 frames from prod_dna_sequence_101_peptide_model_0_compact_compact.xtc (time 0 to 50000 ps)
Read reference structure for fit from prod_start.pdb
Read index groups from dna_sequence_101_peptide_model_0_pca.ndx

Analysis group is 'Backbone_DNA' (2515 atoms)
Fit group is 'Backbone_DNA' (2515 atoms)
Analysis is non-mass weighted
Fit is non-mass weighted
